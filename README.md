# Lumen

The Lumen JavaScript SDK allows you to seamlessly identify and track user attributes and events on your client. Plus other perks.

## Installation

Install the SDK via npm

```sh
npm install lumen-js
```

or yarn

```
yarn add lumen-js
```

The SDK can be used on both the server and the client.

## Initialize the SDK

To use the SDK, you have to initialize the SDK with your public key. Any request that doesn't include a valid API key will return an authorization error.

> API key can be found on your dashboard under the settings#apikey tab. You can also generate new a API key from your Dashboard at any time.

```js
import Lumen from "lumen-js";

const lumenClient = Lumen({
  publicKey: "<your-public-key>",
});
```

## Identify users

You must identify users with a unique identifier before you can track their events. A new customer record is created if the identifier doesn't exist. If the identifier exists, then the customer record is updated with the new data supplied.

> Pro tip: Provide an identifier that is consistent and unique to a user i.e UUID. Avoid using emails for users may change this at any time.

```js
lumenClient.identify("user-unique-identifier", {
  email: "user-email",
  first_name: "john",
  last_name: "doe",
  attributes: "object",
});
```

Ideally, identify should be called when a user creates a new account. To update an existing userâ€™s records, simply call identify and add any property you want to add or change. If the property already exists, we overwrite them. If it is new, we add them to the user's record.

> To ensure your data is in sync with our record, make sure you update your user's records when they change so as to prevent stale data. You can manage your user records on the dashboard.

## Track event

To track an event, simply call the track method. The property object is optional.

```js
// without any property
lumenClient.track("event_name");

// with custom properties

lumenClient.track("event_name", {
  propertyName: "--",
});
```
